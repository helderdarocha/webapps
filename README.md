webapps
=======

Repository for web applications.

I created this as a temporary repository for webapps I developed in Perl, Java, Ruby, HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and it's VERY messy since it includes unversioned code, code from CVS, SVN and Hg repositories, incomplete code and code I used in examples during teaching and mentoring. I will eventually move most of the useful stuff out of here into new repositories.
